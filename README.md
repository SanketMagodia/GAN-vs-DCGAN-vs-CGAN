# Fashion MNIST Generation with Various GAN Architectures


## Description


This project explores three distinct Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for generating images resembling the Fashion MNIST dataset: Normal GANs, DCGANs, and CGANs. Each Jupyter notebook demonstrates a specific implementation, allowing you to easily experiment and compare their capabilities.

## Jupyter Notebooks:

- Normal GAN for Fashion MNIST: Implements the fundamental GAN architecture tailored for the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- DCGAN for Fashion MNIST: Leverages Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) for potential improvements in image quality and stability.
- CGAN for Fashion MNIST: Introduces Conditional GANs (CGANs) with label conditioning, enabling generation of specific fashion items.
